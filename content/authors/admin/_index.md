I am a research assistant in the department of [Computer Science and Automation](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in) at [IISc Bangalore](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in). My research focus is in fairness in machine learning algorithms and biologically plausible learning algorithms in neural networks.

Prior to this, I have worked on various research projects in applications of ML such as sentiment analysis in online discussion forums, knowledge-aware health-care analysis.
